# Tintri REST API Python Examples

*Note*: This repository is now **deprecated**.  Please see the Python examples in the new [tintri-rest-api](https://github.com/Tintri/tintri-rest-api/tree/master/examples/python) repository.

These code examples all use the library tintri_1_1.py.

The examples show how to:
- generate reports
- use service groups
- manipulate QoS
- take snapshots
- set configuration
- obtain statistics
- get recommendations for scale-out

*Note:* These are examples and they might not work in your environment.

For more details, please check-out my [Tintri API and UI Ramblings blog](http://tintriapiui.wordpress.com).
